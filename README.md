## Challenges

The challenges varied in difficulty and type. Below are some highlights:

### Challenge 1: Name

**Description:** This challenge involved analyzing a web application to find hidden flags.

**Approach:** I used tools like Burp Suite and manual testing to uncover vulnerabilities.

### Challenge 2: Name

**Description:** A cryptography challenge that required decoding a message.

**Approach:** I applied various decoding techniques and utilized online tools for assistance.

### Challenge 3: Name

**Description:** This challenge focused on binary exploitation.

**Approach:** I used GDB and other debugging tools to analyze the binary and find the exploit.

## Solutions

In this section, I provide detailed solutions for each challenge. Each write-up includes:

- **Overview:** A brief description of the challenge.
